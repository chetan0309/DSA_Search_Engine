# CodeFinder Search Engine
This project provides an efficient platform for searching for coding problems given a query topic. The purpose of its design is to enrich the learning experience of problem solvers and facilitate their discovery of relevant problems conveniently.
This search engine is designed with the help of TF-IDF Algorithm.

Tech Stacks used for the project are :

* Selenium (for scraping problems' data)
* Python (TF-IDF Implementation)
* Flask (Framework for our back-end server)
* HTML/CSS for Front-end Development
* Chrome WebDriver (latest version)
